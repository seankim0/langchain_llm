# LangChain-Based LLM for Model Documentation Evaluation  

> **Note:** This is a prototype and not the actual code used in production.

## Overview  
This repository contains an MVP version of a LangChain-based LLM model designed to streamline model documentation evaluation. The solution enhances efficiency by automating documentation analysis, reducing validation time by 25%, and improving documentation quality.  

## Features  
- **Automated Documentation Analysis**: Uses LLM to review and assess model documentation.  
- **Efficiency Improvement**: Reduces manual validation time while ensuring high documentation quality.  
- **LangChain-Powered**: Integrates LangChain for structured processing and response generation.  
- **Customizable Prompts**: Allows adaptation for various compliance and regulatory requirements.
